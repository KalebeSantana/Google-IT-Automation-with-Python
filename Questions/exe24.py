Modify the student_grade function using the format method, so that it returns the phrase "X received Y% on the exam". 
For example, student_grade("Reed", 80) should return "Reed received 80% on the exam".

=======
Want to give it a go yourself? Be my guest! Modify the first_and_last function so that it returns True if the first letter of 
the string is the same as the last letter of the string, False if theyâ€™re different. Remember that you can access characters 
using message[0] or message[-1]. Be careful how you handle the empty string, which should return True since nothing is equal to nothing.

    return False
